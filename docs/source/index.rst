The Python world certainly doesn't need more web frameworks. But, it does need more creativity, so I thought I'd
spread some `Hacktoberfest <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/>`_ spirit around, bring some of my ideas to the table, and see what I could come up with.

An Example Web Service:
-----------------------

.. code:: python

   import responder

   api = responder.API()

   @api.route("/{greeting}")
   async def greet_world(req, resp, *, greeting):
       resp.text = f"{greeting}, world!"

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       api.run()

That ``async`` declaration is optional.

This gets you a ASGI app, with a production static files server
pre-installed, jinja2 templating (without additional imports), and a
production webserver based on uvloop, serving up requests with gzip
compression automatically.

Installing Responder
====================

Install the latest release:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pipenv install responder
    ‚ú®üç∞‚ú®


Or, install from the development branch:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder.git#egg=responder


Only **Python 3.6+** is supported.



Web Service Performance Characteristics
---------------------------------------

The objective of these benchmark tests is not testing deployment (like uwsgi vs gunicorn vs uvicorn etc) but instead test the performance of python-response against other popular Python web frameworks.

Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~

The results below were gotten running the performance tests on a Lenovo
W530, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3740QM CPU @ 2.70GHz, MEM: 32GB, Linux Mint
19. I used Python 3.7.0 with the WRK utility with params: wrk -d20s -t10
-c200 (i.e. 10 threads and 200 connections).

The Basic Idea
--------------

The primary concept here is to bring the niceties that are brought forth from both Flask and Falcon and unify them into a single framework, along with some new ideas I have. I also wanted to take some of the API primitives that are instilled in the Requests library and put them into a web framework. So, you'll find a lot of parallels here with Requests.

- Setting ``resp.text`` sends back unicode, while setting ``resp.content`` sends back bytes.
- Setting ``resp.media`` sends back JSON/YAML (``.text``/``.content`` override this).
- Case-insensitive ``req.headers`` dict (from Requests directly).
- ``resp.status_code``, ``req.method``, ``req.url``, and other familiar friends.

Ideas
-----

- Flask-style route expression, with new capabilities -- all while using Python 3.6+'s new f-string syntax.
- I love Falcon's "every request and response is passed into to each view and mutated" methodology, especially ``response.media``, and have used it here. In addition to supporting JSON, I have decided to support YAML as well, as Kubernetes is slowly taking over the world, and it uses YAML for all the things. Content-negotiation and all that.
- **A built in testing client that uses the actual Requests you know and love**.
- The ability to mount other WSGI apps easily.
- Automatic gzipped-responses.
- In addition to Falcon's ``on_get``, ``on_post``, etc methods, Responder features an ``on_request`` method, which gets called on every type of request, much like Requests.
- A production static files server is built-in.
- Uvicorn built-in as a production web server. I would have chosen Gunicorn, but it doesn't run on Windows. Plus, Uvicorn serves well to protect against slowloris attacks, making nginx unneccessary in production.
- GraphQL support, via Graphene. The goal here is to have any GraphQL query exposable at any route, magically.


Future Ideas
------------

- Cookie-based sessions are currently an afterthought, as this is an API framework, but websites are APIs too.
- If frontend websites are supported, provide an official way to run webpack.
