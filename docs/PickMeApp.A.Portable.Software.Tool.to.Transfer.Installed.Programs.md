PickMeApp supports Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. It can transfer both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. It can also handle programs that require administrator privileges or special installation procedures. PickMeApp uses Portable Application Description (PAD) and TAPP Application Description (TAD) formats to describe and install programs silently. PickMeApp also includes an updated PickMeApp Collection of 71 popular one-click installable programs that are linked directly to their original publisher sites.
 
You can download PickMeApp 0.6.3.1 Portable .zip 1 from [pickmeapp.com](https://pickmeapp.com/download). Note that you need to register with your email address to get a unique PickMeApp ID that allows you to request support, receive updates, and enjoy many other features available for registered users. Alternatively, you can download a non-personal PickMeApp from the same site without registration, but you will not have access to those features.
 
PickMeApp is a handy tool for anyone who wants to migrate their programs and settings to a new PC or backup their applications for future use. It can save you time and hassle by avoiding tedious installations and configurations. PickMeApp is also useful for testing new programs without affecting your system or creating system restore points.

To use PickMeApp, you need to run it on both the source and the target PCs. On the source PC, you can select the programs you want to transfer from the list of installed applications. You can also add programs from the PickMeApp Collection or from your own PAD or TAD files. PickMeApp will then create a backup file that contains all the selected programs and their settings. You can save this file to a removable drive or upload it to a cloud storage service.
 
On the target PC, you need to run PickMeApp again and select the backup file you created on the source PC. PickMeApp will then restore all the programs and their settings to the target PC. You can choose to overwrite existing programs or skip them if you prefer. PickMeApp will also create a restore point before installing any programs, so you can undo the changes if needed.
 
PickMeApp is a beta version and may have some bugs or limitations. It is recommended to test it on a non-critical system before using it on your main PC. You should also backup your data and create a system image before transferring any programs. PickMeApp does not guarantee that all programs will work properly after the transfer, as some programs may require additional steps or components to function correctly. You should always check the program's website or documentation for more information.
