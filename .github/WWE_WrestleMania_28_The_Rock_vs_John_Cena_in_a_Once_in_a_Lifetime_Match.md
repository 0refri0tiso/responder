The Rock and John Cena had been feuding since WrestleMania XXVII, where The Rock interfered in the WWE Championship match between Cena and The Miz, costing Cena the title. The Rock and Cena agreed to face each other at WrestleMania XXVIII, one year in advance. The build-up to the match involved both men exchanging insults and attacks on each other, as well as involving other WWE superstars such as CM Punk, Kane, Mick Foley, and Zack Ryder.
 
The match itself was a back-and-forth affair that lasted for 33 minutes. Both men delivered their signature moves and kicked out of each other's finishers. The Rock survived two Attitude Adjustments from Cena, while Cena kicked out of two Rock Bottoms and one People's Elbow from The Rock. The end came when Cena attempted to mock The Rock by going for another People's Elbow, but The Rock sprang up and hit Cena with a third Rock Bottom for the pinfall victory.
 
The Rock celebrated his win with the crowd, while Cena sat dejectedly on the ramp. The two men shook hands and hugged after the match, showing respect for each other. The Rock then raised Cena's arm and pointed at him, acknowledging his effort. The show ended with The Rock posing on the turnbuckle as fireworks went off.
 
WWE WrestleMania 28 was a huge success, setting records for the highest buy rate and overall gross of any WrestleMania thus far. The event was watched by around 1.2 million people worldwide, and earned nearly $9 million in ticket sales. The match between The Rock and John Cena was widely praised by fans and critics alike, and is considered one of the greatest matches in WWE history.

WWE WrestleMania 28 also featured other matches that showcased the talent and diversity of the WWE roster. In the opening match, Sheamus defeated Daniel Bryan in 18 seconds to win the World Heavyweight Championship, after Bryan was distracted by a kiss from his girlfriend AJ Lee. Sheamus capitalized on the opportunity and hit Bryan with a Brogue Kick for the quick win.
 
In another match, Kane defeated Randy Orton in a hard-hitting contest that lasted for 11 minutes. Kane and Orton had been feuding for weeks, with Kane claiming that he wanted to prove that he was still a monster by destroying Orton. Orton fought back with his signature moves, but Kane surprised him with a Chokeslam from the top rope for the victory.
 
One of the most emotional matches of the night was the Intercontinental Championship match between Big Show and Cody Rhodes. Rhodes had been mocking Big Show for his past WrestleMania failures, and vowed to retain his title against him. Big Show proved him wrong by dominating Rhodes and knocking him out with a WMD punch to win the title. Big Show celebrated his first Intercontinental Championship win with tears of joy.
